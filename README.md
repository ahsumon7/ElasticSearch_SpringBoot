Spring Boot & Elasticsearch Product Search Application

Built a scalable Java Spring Boot application integrated with Elasticsearch for lightning-fast product search.

Implemented CRUD operations and full-text search APIs (POST /products, GET /products/search) for dynamic product management.

Designed optimized Elasticsearch indices to enable efficient filtering, aggregation, and real-time search over large datasets.

Leveraged Spring Data Elasticsearch for seamless repository integration and Lombok to reduce boilerplate code.

Ensured application reliability with Postman and curl testing, and deployed using Docker for Elasticsearch and Kibana visualization.

Followed a clean architecture pattern with controller, service, and repository layers for maintainable and extendable code.
