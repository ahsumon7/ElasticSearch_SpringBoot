Spring Boot + Elasticsearch Product Search Application

Developed a full-stack Java Spring Boot application integrating Elasticsearch for fast, scalable product search.

Implemented CRUD operations and full-text search with REST APIs (POST /products, GET /products/search).

Designed Elasticsearch indices for optimized search and filtering by product attributes.

Used Spring Data Elasticsearch for repository abstraction and simplified interaction with Elasticsearch.

Enabled real-time search and aggregation to handle large product datasets efficiently.

Built clean architecture with controller, service, repository layers and Lombok for reducing boilerplate.

Tested APIs with Postman and curl, ensuring reliable indexing and search functionality.

Deployed locally using Docker for Elasticsearch and Kibana for visualization and monitoring.
